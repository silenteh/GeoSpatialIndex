This is a work in progress....

The idea is to build a library which contains several Geo Spatial Indexes, 
and then use this library to add a new Column Type in Apache Cassandra 

The only two methods implemented for now are:

- inserting of a record in the RTree
- searching for records in the RTree

Rtree TODO:
- better test suite
- deletion of records
- nearest neighbor search
- range neighbour search
